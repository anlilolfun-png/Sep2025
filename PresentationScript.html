    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>1. Introduction (Speaker 1 – Trishanth | ~2 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="speaker-tag">Speaker 1</div>
    <p>
      "Good morning, everyone. My name is Trishanth, and together with my teammates Zhi Yen and Anli, we’ll be presenting on <span class='highlight'>Smart City Networking</span>—the digital backbone of modern urban life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As global urbanization accelerates, cities face growing challenges: traffic congestion, energy waste, inefficient public services, and environmental strain. Smart cities offer a solution by leveraging <span class='highlight'>networking infrastructure</span> to connect devices, data, and people in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, we’ll cover:  
      <ul>
        <li>What smart city networking is and why it matters,</li>
        <li>Four key applications across transport, energy, waste, and healthcare,</li>
        <li>The core technologies enabling it—like IoT, 5G, and cloud,</li>
        <li>A real-world case study: Singapore’s Smart Nation,</li>
        <li>And the major challenges—and how to solve them.</li>
      </ul>
      Let’s begin."
    </p>

    <!-- PART 1: DEFINITION & APPLICATIONS -->
    <h2>2. Definition & Applications (Speaker 1 – Trishanth | ~4 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="speaker-tag">Speaker 1</div>
    <p>
      "First—what is smart city networking? It’s not just Wi-Fi. It’s a <span class='highlight'>multilayered ecosystem</span> of sensors, communication protocols, data centers, and cloud platforms that collect, transmit, and analyze real-time urban data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its importance lies in six key areas: operational efficiency, data-driven decisions, resource optimization, sustainability, improved quality of life, and seamless integration across sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let’s look at four real-world applications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smart Traffic Management:</strong> In Singapore, adaptive traffic lights use real-time data to cut commute times by 20%.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Energy Grids:</strong> Utilities monitor usage, detect outages instantly, and integrate solar/wind power efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Waste Systems:</strong> Sensors in bins notify collectors only when full—reducing fuel use and costs by up to 30% in cities like Seoul.</li>
      <li><strong>Connected Healthcare:</strong> Wearables send patient data to hospitals before ambulances even arrive—saving critical minutes in emergencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- PART 2: TECHNOLOGIES & CASE STUDY -->
    <h2>3. Enabling Technologies & Case Study (Speaker 2 – Lim Zhi Yen | ~4 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="speaker-tag">Speaker 2</div>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Trishanth. I’m Zhi Yen, and I’ll cover the <span class='highlight'>enabling technologies</span> and a powerful real-world example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three core technologies make smart city networking possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IoT:</strong> Millions of sensors—from streetlights to parking spots—generate real-time urban data.</li>
      <li><strong>5G:</strong> Ultra-fast, low-latency connectivity supports autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and massive device networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud & Edge Computing:</strong> Cloud stores and analyzes city-wide data, while edge computing processes it locally for instant response—like stopping a traffic light within milliseconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now, the case study: <span class='highlight'>Singapore’s Smart Nation Initiative</span>, launched in 2014.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Singapore built a nationwide fiber network and rolled out 5G citywide.</li>
      <li>Its Smart Nation Sensor Platform collects data on everything from air quality to crowd density.</li>
      <li>Results? 15% less traffic congestion, 10% energy savings in public buildings, and seamless digital government services like HealthHub.</li>
      <li>It’s not just tech—it’s a citizen-centered vision that’s making Singapore a global model.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- PART 3: CHALLENGES & CONCLUSION -->
    <h2>4. Challenges & Conclusion (Speaker 3 – Anli Ho | ~4 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="speaker-tag">Speaker 3</div>
    <p>
      "Hi, I’m Anli. While smart cities promise huge benefits, they also face <span class='highlight'>significant challenges</span>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Privacy & Security:</strong> Mass data collection risks breaches. <em>Solution:</em> Strong encryption and compliance with standards like ISO 27001.</li>
      <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Devices from different vendors often don’t talk to each other. <em>Solution:</em> Adopt open protocols like MQTT or CoAP.</li>
      <li><strong>High Costs:</strong> Fiber, 5G, and IoT deployment are expensive. <em>Solution:</em> Public-private partnerships and phased rollouts.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Millions of devices can overwhelm networks. <em>Solution:</em> Use edge computing to process data closer to the source.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> Vulnerable groups may be excluded. <em>Solution:</em> Offer free public Wi-Fi and digital literacy programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In conclusion, smart city networking is the <span class='highlight'>nervous system of modern urban life</span>. It transforms how we move, consume energy, manage waste, and access healthcare. But technology alone isn’t enough—it must be <span class='highlight'>inclusive, secure, and sustainable</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Singapore shows, with vision, collaboration, and citizen trust, we can build cities that are not just smart—but truly human-centered.
