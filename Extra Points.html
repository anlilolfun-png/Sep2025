<p>Since we haven't reached the time, we have an extra point to discuss.</p>
<br>
<p>First of all,
✅ 1. Emphasize “Network Architecture” Layers</p><p>
Your report mentions a “Smart City Network Architecture Diagram” (Illustration 1). In Q&A, we briefly explain the 3-layer model:</p>
<p>
Perception Layer: IoT sensors (traffic, air quality, bins).</p><p>
Network Layer: 5G, fiber, LPWAN (e.g., NB-IoT), gateways.</p><p>
Application Layer: Cloud platforms, dashboards (e.g., HealthHub, smart traffic control).</p><p>
🔹 Why it matters: Shows you understand how data flows—not just what it does.
</p>
<br><p>
Furthermore,
✅ 2. Mention Specific Protocols</p>
<p>Go beyond “MQTT/CoAP” by giving one real example:
</p><p>
“In Singapore’s sensor network, MQTT is used because it’s lightweight and ideal for low-bandwidth devices like parking sensors.”
</p><p>
This demonstrates technical depth beyond generic textbook answers.
</p><br>

<p>

Besides,
✅ 3. Highlight Sustainability Metrics</p><p>
Your report notes “10% energy savings” in Singapore. Add a global benchmark:</p><p>

“According to the World Economic Forum (2021), smart grids can reduce city-wide electricity consumption by up to 15%, while smart lighting cuts public energy use by 30–50%.”</p><p>

🔹 Why it matters: Links your case study to global impact—ideal for critical thinking.
</p>
<br><p>
Moreover,
✅ 4. Address “Data Ownership” (Ethical Angle)</p><p>
The assignment lists privacy as a challenge—but who owns the data?
</p><p>
“In smart cities, citizens often don’t control their own mobility or energy data. Singapore addresses this through its National Digital Identity (NDI) system, giving citizens consent-based control.”
</p><p>
🔹 Why it matters: Shows ethical awareness—a key trait of high-scoring reports.
</p>
<br><p>
Additionally,
✅ 5. Include a Future Trend: Digital Twins
</p><p>
“The next evolution is the digital twin—a real-time virtual replica of the city. Singapore’s ‘Virtual Singapore’ platform allows planners to simulate traffic changes or disaster responses before implementing them physically.”
</p><p>
🔹 Why it matters: Demonstrates forward-thinking analysis, not just summary.
</p>
<br><p>
After that,
✅ 6. Connect to Malaysia (Local Relevance)</p><p>
Since your college is in Malaysia, add 1 sentence in Q&A or conclusion:
</p><p>
“While Singapore leads, Malaysia’s Smart City Framework (2021) is piloting smart traffic in KL and Iskandar—showing regional momentum.”
</p><p>
🔹 Why it matters: Shows contextual awareness—highly valued in assessments.
</p>
<br><p>
Last but not least,
✅ 7. Bonus Slide Idea (If Allowed)
</p><p>Add a “Lessons for Malaysia” slide:
</p>
<p>Start small (e.g., smart parking in KLCC)
</p><p>Use govt initiatives like MyDIGITAL
</p><p>Prioritize citizen trust & digital inclusion
</p>
